[{"content":"TOEFL Writing Integrated Writing Module Briefly, concisely and accurately\nWe can learn from the reading that Reading-Fact. Three theories are proposed in the reading Reading-point, while all of them are of refuted by the lecture, which states that Listening-Point.\nFirst, the reading claims that R1-theory, as R1-reason. However, the lecture does not agree with the idea and claims that L1-reason.\nSecond, the reading indicates that R2-theory, which is reflected by R2-reason. Nevertheless, the lecture counteracts the idea: L2-reason.\nThird, the reading demonstrates that R3-reason, since R3-reason. Still, the lecture argues against such opinion-L3-reason.\nExample We can learn from the reading that a large, oval-shape ceramic vessel with intricate carvings was discovered in central Italy, possibly dating back to the 4th century BCE. Three theories are proposed in the reading rega rding its purpose, while all of them are refuted by the lecture, which states that all these theories have flaw and non can be definitely proven.\nFirst, the reading claims that the vessel was used in religious ceremonies as the carvings on the vessel depict scenes of offering deities, possibly showing the purpose of a container for animal sacrifice to gods for blessing. However, the lecture does not agree with the idea and claims that it was common to illustrate culture narratives on everyday items, denying the religious purpose of the vessel. For example, many common items used today, such as vases and teapots, come with depictions of historical and mythical characters and events.\nSecond, the reading indicates that the vessel was used for storing food and drink, which is reflected in historical records and findings and suggested by the large size and sturdy construction of the vessel. Nevertheless, the lecture counteracts the idea: the intricate carvings on the vessel required great effort, and it was unlikely for people to use such an item for mundane purpose. In addition, the vessel was discovered in pristine condition, showing no wear and tear from daily handling.\nThird, the reading demonstrates that the vessel might have been used as a funerary object since similar vessels were found in other burial sites. Furthermore, the intricate carvings on the vessel are highly decorative, and they possibly represented homage to the deceased. Still, the lecture argues against such opinion- the number of this type of pottery is too small to prove wide funerary use. Besides, recent discoveries show that funerary objects in that part of Italy were almost all stone tools so the locals might have actually preferred practical items ovel symbolic ones for funerary objects.\nAcademic Discussion Question Types Evaluation 40% discuss the advantage/disadvantage of one thing(whether it is good) Comparison 30% dicuss the benefit/harm of two thing(which one is better) Solution 15% give a solution to some problem(a good/better answer) Argument 15% if you are approve the view, and why(whether it is right) Topics Education 25% Work \u0026amp; Business 20% Profit Maximazation-Generate revenue \u0026amp; reduce costs to ensure profitablity Growth \u0026amp; Expansion-Increase market share \u0026amp; develop new market Better Products \u0026amp; Customer Satisfaction-Provide products/services better than competitors Improvement \u0026amp; Innovation-Continuously improve and create new products \u0026amp; services Employee Well-being \u0026amp; Satisfaction 6 Social \u0026amp; Enviromental Responsibility Environment 15% Tech 15% Urban Development 15% Economy 5% Social Issues 5% Obejective Topic: 120-180 words of relevant discussion with reasoning, example, and preferably concession Coherence: Clear topic, flow of idea, adn connection between sentences Language: Various, accurate and natural Grammar: A mix of simple and complex sentences, preferably with atrributive clauses and participles Structure - evaluation/comparison Point \u0026amp; Elaboraiton + Further Elaboration + Example + Concession Point \u0026amp; Elaboration + Further Elaboration + Seconde Point \u0026amp; Elaboration + Further Elaboration Point \u0026amp; Elaboration + Further Elaboration + Full Concession Point \u0026amp; Elaboration + Further Elaboration + Sublimation Common Points in Educaiton: Academic development / Effectiveness of study Personal development / Career development Teamworking and communication skills Training I believe grading shall focus on studens\u0026rsquo; efforts on assignments since we shall encourage their spirit to overcome problems rather than ignore their efforts. （我发现我经常有逻辑断点，通常需要两句或者更多句才能表达出我的想法。例如，我们要鼓励学生努力+努力才能克服困难/克服困难的品质更重要）\nIn my opinion, effort is an important element to be considered in study and grading due to the fact that students learn from both what they have done right and what they have done wrong.\nQuestion: Which approach do you think is better: assessing students based only on their performance, or also based on their effort?\nAnswer\nAs far as I am considered, effort is an important element to be considered in study and grading due to the fact that students learn from both what they have done right and wrong.\nTo elaborate, both right and wrong experience can help student better understand knowledge. For example,\nAlso, grading based on effort can help students\u0026rsquo; build their resilience, which is a vital spirit in their future life. To be more specific, those students whose efforts received affirmation will have more motivation to focus on their assignment For example, although a student get a wrong answer in the assignment, his effort has been recognized as an important part\nQuestion: What is opinion on gap year? Does it bring more advantages or disadvantages to students?\nAnswer\nMy opinion is gap year can help student find their favors and practice their ability since during this year students can try many things they are favor of and learn much from this experience.\nTo elaborate, slow down and focus on the right direction is more effective than keep going on the wrong way. Students need time to know their interests, while the gap year can give them a chance to try. For example, students who make use of this time to have a internship in business may have a better understanding of business, driving them to build a real passion in their future pursuit.\nStill, some may claims that gap year may be a waste of time or a more expensive option to college as unversity cost is more and more expensive. However, as for the long life a person can live and the huge health one can make in his whole life, this cost is not so expensive, which means we can use this time to prepare for the future.\nQuestion: Do you think ongoing job training is the most important investment a business can make?\nAnswer\nI believe that ongoing job training is the most important investment a business can make based on the fact that we can not always get the perfect person but with training one can make himself the perfect person for this job.\nTo elaborate, a person get a job doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that this person have all the properties this job needed but some central abilities, which is most valuable in the job. For example, a man who have a great intuition in market may lack the ability in data anylitical tools. Only by ongoing job training can this man better use these tools to make efficient policy.\nOfficial\nIt is certain that ongoning job training is an essential part of business because it helps employees to stay competitive in today\u0026rsquo;s rapidly changing world.\nTo be more specific, instead of relying on outdated skillsets, ongoing job trainging not only provdies employees an insight into advanced strategies but also equips them with competitive technical skills, which in turn helps the company to keep vibrant.\nQuestion: What is the biggest mistake that people make when it comes to the purchase of tech prodcuts?\nAnswer\nIn my opinion, the biggest mistake people may make when they are puchasing tech products is the ignore of requirement.\nTo elaborate, one can easily diffused by the all kinds of tech products in the market, which are different in shapes, different in parameters and different in systems. Among these devices, some prodcuts are regarded as more powerful in all aspects. However, people who ignore their turly requirement may be cheated by themselves-these products are better, but they don\u0026rsquo;t need to pruchase which means a waste of money.\nOfficial\nThe biggest mistake in the purchase of tech product is that consumers almost always pay for what they do not need since people are easily misled by advertisements.\nTo elaborate, TV and internet commericials usually illustrate the most sophisticated and powerful function of high-tech products in an exaggerated manner, which are unforunately rarely needed.\nopinion\nElectronic devices help students on their study\nSubstantiation\nFor example, search engine on electronic devices provides many learning literature which can answer most of the students\u0026rsquo; questions, (greatly) giving them more chance to learning by themselves.\nFor example, students can find different ways of thinking for whatever questions they have with their mobile phones wherever the are, greatly broadening their mind.\nStory telling\nFor instance, last week, my little niece had a homework from her biology class about animal behaviors.\nInstead of relying on limited knowledge on books, she used her mobile phone to search for diverse information on the internet, including why and how animals play, which earned her a good grade for the excellent work.\nOpposite opinion\nStudents will lose communication skills. They shall study with classmates and teachers.\nConcession\nStill/Nevertheless, some may might claims / a voice arises that students could lose communication skills and they ought to study with those around them. However/Ironically, devices such as smart phones actually bring students closer to communication appications, while with proper guidance devices such as computers can significantly promote the efficency of group work.\nTraining 1 The reading passage discusses the benefits of planting genetically modified trees, suggesting that these trees are hardier, provide economic advantages, and help protect wild trees from overexploitation. The lecture, however, challenges each of these points, arguing that genetically modified trees may pose significant ecological and financial challenges.\n两种基本句式: 先说结果，再说原因 A is more likely B, since C. 直接说结果，举例论证 A is more likely B, which is showed by C Someone claims that A, citing B 先说特征，再做因果推理 A is B, making C. A is B, so C. 多层结果递进 A is B, so C, making/ensuring D. 这种多层级是托福写作喜欢的，不能特别多，最好就三个，其中一个从句应该短小一些，不造成阅读负担。\n也就是说读的时候要想主句，最重要的句子在哪，不是所有被修饰的都是主句。\n一个小 tip: 写综合写作的时候立论要(相对)更加支持 lecturer, 所以简单概括阅读观点，然后详细阐述 lecturer 观点 First, the reading claims that genetically modified trees are more likely to survive than natural trees(结论先行), citing a pest-resistant papaya in Hawaii that prevented ringspot virus damage（ 举例补充）. In contrast(对比), the lecturer points out that genetically modified trees are genetically uniform(特征描述), making them highly vulnerable to environmental changes they were not engineered for(原因 + 结果). Natural trees（反过来补充）, by comparison, are genetically diverse, so at least some individuals can survive most threats, ensuring species survival.(一个两层结果递进, A is B, so C, making/ensuring D.)\nMoreover(其次), the reading suggests that genetically modified trees offer economic genefits because they grow faster, yield more products and require fewer pesticides(结论先行+并列原因). The lecturer counters this (冒号说明)by highlighting associated financial burdens: farmers must pay higher prices for seeds,(两个并列原因) and legal restrictions prevent them from freely propagating the trees.\nFinally(最后), the reading proposes that genetically modified trees can protect wild trees by satisfying wood demand. The lecturer argues that these trees may actually(加一个表转折) harm native species because they exhibit competitive growth patterns, competing for sunlight, soil nutrients, and water, and protentially crowding out natural trees.(感觉 gpt 逗号用的太多)\nIn conclusion, while the reading emphasizes potential advantages, the lecture demonstrates that genetically that genetically modified trees can create serious ecological and conomic risks, calling their benefits into question.\n2 The reading passage discusses the\n","date":"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://nopanicer.github.io/p/toefl-preparation/","title":"TOEFL Preparation"},{"content":" 强化学习的终极目标是求解一个最优策略.\nOverview Not just the map of this course, but also for RL foundations Fundamental tools + Algorithms and methods Importance of different parts Chapter 1: Basic Concpets Concepts: state, action, reward, return, episode, policy Grid-world examples Markov decision process (MDP) Fundamental concepts, widely used later Chapter 2: Bellman Equation One concept.

we need World Models 知识训练——\u0026gt;特征提取——\u0026gt;数据驱动\n人工智能，21世纪时下最热门的议题，走过了他的第 69 个春秋。在1956 年的达特茅斯会议上，涌现了一批以Minskey为首的人工智能学家。所谓人工智能就是对智能的模仿，是一种数字化，程序化智能的方式。秉持着这种思想，最早的人工智能学者们认为智能来源于逻辑能力，毕竟人类历史上最伟大的思想都是来源于逻辑的推断。 Minskey 等人通过构筑 GTP 等成果实现了自动推理的机器，这种机器通过将知识与规则编码入程序之中，可以依照某种程序化的范本完成一些智能的行为，实现简单命题的证明，这种智能哲学后来被称为符号主义。当时人们对这种自动定理证明机满怀信心，认为只要给定足够多的规则，足够完善的信息，就可以实现同人类相当的智能。专家系统如雨后春笋般出现，并快速得在人类历史中产生影响。但随着时间的推理，人们发现这种固定化的程序并不适用现实生活————原因在于现实中的环境时常发生变动，所以需要有人持续维护程序中的规则和知识。这种体力劳动并不比完全不使用专家系统轻松，所以没多长时间，这种专家系统几乎销声匿迹了。符号主义对于实现形式化验证是一种极大的助力，但是没有证据表明这种机器能够涌现出自我推理的创造力。 这之后的人工智能学家仅仅拥有逻辑的机器是称不上智能的，类似于人类会对现实中的事物观察，归纳，总结规律，智能也应当拥有总结和抽象概括的能力，换言之，应当具有模式识别的能力。万幸的是，基于归纳数学家已经发展出了一套完善的方法，将统计学习的思想带入人工智能，我们可以将智能理解为建立在某种模型之上对于参数的学习。比如给出一个地区的历年的方法，我们可以选取不同的多项式模型拟合，使用最小二乘法，我们就可以学习到在给定模型下最优的参数，变相的，我们相当于学习到了数据背后的“规律”。关于具体的模型选取这部分非常复杂，正确的模型能够极好的预测未学习的数据，而错误的模型只能在拟合效果上优良，在真实环境中表现一塌糊涂。特征工程随之成为了当时机器学习的主要目标，人们争先根据自己的经验、对智能的理解建立大量的特征，以此训练出许多模型。这些模型从现在的角度来看效果也是不错的，但是这种学习属于特化学习，即便目标看起来相似的两种模型，其需要的特征也未必相同（如同样是图片识别任务，识别景物和识别小动物的特征选取或许就完全不同），且受限于现实世界中任务的复杂多样，以这种方式训练出来的模型泛化效果很差，缺乏实现多种任务的能力。 基于特征提取的统计机器学习最大的不便之处在于手动设计特征效果低下。通过一种简单的思想我们可以省去这种麻烦————复杂来源于简单的叠加，即便是使用简单的线性函数（加上一点不那么线性的函数），也可以模拟复杂的特征所表示的信息。我们可以让机器模拟神经元来产生于类似脑信号的效果，神经细胞突触末端可以传递信号，一些信号表现为激活特性，而另一些则表示为抑制特性，当同一细胞接收到的信号激活大于抑制时，我们可以继续激活下一层神经细胞，反之信号则终止传递（事实上，我这里所说也正是所有深度网络中发生的事情）。人工智能的研究步入连接主义的时代，模型的训练步入数据驱动的阶段，我们只需要通过大量数据灌输训练，模型可以自己发现数据背后的规律，这种智能在某种程度上达到甚至超过了人类水平。通过使用人类信息时代产生的几乎所有数据，基于 transformer 的大语言模型已经在自然语言处理领域达到了极强的水平。从知识水平的高低来看，GPT 类模型已经足够强大，但是我们必须发问，智能是否仅仅等于知识？\n精炼版：为何当下必须讨论 World Models 回顾上面保留的原始发展脉络，可以抽象为一条“表示方式演进”与“泛化方式演进”的双线：\n符号主义（规则→推理）：显式知识 + 演绎，缺乏适应性与自动扩展。 统计学习（模型→参数）：用归纳取代纯规则，但强依赖手工特征与任务定制。 特征工程阶段（经验→特化）：专家主导表示，迁移差、成本高。 连接主义 / 深度学习（分层→自动抽象）：端到端表示学习替代手工特征，但对外部世界的结构理解仍薄弱。 大模型时代（海量数据→模式压缩）：语言与多模态模式被高度建模，但缺乏稳定的“世界因果 + 可操作物理 + 长期规划”能力。 因此出现瓶颈：仅依靠“被动模式匹配”与“记忆式知识复用”不足以支撑真正的通用智能（AGI）与跨任务迁移。我们需要能在以下维度前移的机制：\n状态建模：从“文本/像素表面”到“潜在可操作世界状态（Latent actionable state）”。 因果与可证伪：能够回答“如果我改变 X，Y 会怎样”，并支持反事实比较。 长期预测：不只是下一 token / 下一帧，而是跨时间跨度稳定滚动模拟。 主动探索：在未知下建立不确定性表征与信息增益策略（curiosity / intrinsic motivation）。 规划与控制接口：让模型输出可以映射为环境可执行动作序列而非仅自然语言。 错误内省与自我修正：具备“模型→环境→偏差诊断→局部更新”闭环。 资源效率：少样本、离线数据再利用、世界模型内部生成合成经验（dreaming / imagination）。 World Models 正是对上述能力的承载：它不是简单的“更大的语言模型”，而是一套把感知、记忆、预测、规划、执行、纠错统合为一个可迭代循环的结构化系统。其核心思想：\n使用分层表征（例如：像素→对象→关系→动态方程）。 将环境动态显式参数化（或隐式潜变量学习），支持 rollout。 通过内部模拟减少真实交互成本（model-based RL / imagination-based planning）。 在策略生成前先进行多分支前瞻（branching futures），筛选风险与收益。 将错误（预测残差）直接反馈到世界模型更新，而非仅更新策略头。 支持跨领域迁移：世界结构部分复用，不同任务只更换目标函数。 与“仅知识累计”相比，World Models 关注“结构 + 动态 + 可操作性”。它的出现使得智能从“被动回答”转向“主动构思与试验”，为：\n更安全的决策（提前模拟后果）。 更强的鲁棒性（对未知输入有预测与回退机制）。 更好的可解释性（内部状态可以与真实世界因素映射）。 更高的样本效率（生成内部经验，减少外部试错）。 一句话总结：World Models 让 AI 不再只是“记住世界”，而是“内部重建并可操纵一个世界”，从而迈向具备理解、预测、规划与自我修复能力的下一代智能系统。\n注：以上为结构化浓缩，保留原始段落以供风格与语义对照。\n世界模型是什么 如果AGI实现了，那不就是可以通过AGI生成游戏世界了 世界模型需要什么， 面对未知得能力 JEPA原来是这么个东西 Understanding Predicting Planning 世界需要理解错误，能纠错，需要自己解决bug 世界模型是人工智能系统对外部世界的内部表征或模拟。它就像AI的“大脑”中的一个虚拟沙盒，让AI能够理解、预测和推理现实世界的运作方式，包括物理规律、因果关系和物体运动。\n我们人类在做任何事情之前，都会在脑海中对即将发生的事情进行模拟和预测。比如，一个棒球运动员能够击中告诉飞来的棒球，是因为他的大脑能够快速预测棒球的飞行轨迹，并在潜意识中做出反应。这种预测能力，就是基于他对世界的内部模型。\n一个世界模型通常包含以下核心能力：\n内部表征（Internal Representation） : 将高维的原始数据编码为低维、简洁的潜在状态，形成对世界的抽象和概括。 未来预测（Future Prediction）： 基于当前状态和采取的行动，预测未来可能发生的状态变化。 因果推理（Causal Reasoning）： 理解“如果……会发生什么”的问题，即能够进行反事实推理。1 参考文献
